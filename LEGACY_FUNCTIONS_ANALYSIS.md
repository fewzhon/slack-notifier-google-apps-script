# Legacy Functions Analysis

## üîç Situation

You were right to question this! The functions **have NOT been moved** from the old `.gs` files to the new refactored structure. They still only exist in `src/.bin/driveMonitor.gs` (the legacy folder).

---

## ‚ùå Current Problem

`Application.js` is trying to call functions that don't exist in the new codebase:
- `aggregateDailyChangesFromSheet()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/driveMonitor.gs`
- `aggregateWeeklyChangesFromSheet()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/driveMonitor.gs`
- `formatDailySummaryBlockKit()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/driveMonitor.gs`
- `formatWeeklySummaryBlockKit()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/driveMonitor.gs`
- `sendDailySummaryToSlack()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/driveMonitor.gs`
- `getLogSheetUrl()` - ‚ùå Only in `.bin/utils.gs`

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Port These Functions Properly

We need to create new modules in the refactored structure that implement these functions. Here are the options:

### **Option 1: Create New Summary Modules (Recommended)**

Create proper modules in the new structure:

1. **`src/core/entities/Summary.js`** - Summary entity classes
   - `DailySummary` class
   - `WeeklySummary` class

2. **`src/infrastructure/google/SheetAggregator.js`** - Replace `aggregateDailyChangesFromSheet()`
   - Aggregates data from Google Sheets
   - Returns summary objects

3. **`src/infrastructure/slack/BlockKitFormatter.js`** - Replace Block Kit formatters
   - `formatDailySummaryBlocks()` method
   - `formatWeeklySummaryBlocks()` method

4. **`src/infrastructure/slack/SlackBlockKitSender.js`** - Replace `sendDailySummaryToSlack()`
   - Send Block Kit blocks to Slack

### **Option 2: Keep Using .bin Files (Temporary)**

Since these are still legacy `.gs` files, we could:
- Keep them in `.bin` for now
- Mark them as "legacy but in use"
- Add comments in Application.js saying they'll be refactored

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**

- Port the data aggregation logic to new modules
- Keep the Block Kit formatting in `.bin` for now (as it's Slack-specific)
- Refactor gradually

---

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Keep using `.bin/driveMonitor.gs` for now** because:
1. These functions work and are tested
2. They're specifically for Slack Block Kit formatting (domain-specific)
3. The refactor goal was Clean Architecture, but these are utility functions
4. We can mark them as "legacy but maintained"

**BUT:** Update `Application.js` to use the existing Notification approach from the refactored codebase, rather than calling old functions directly.

---

## üîÑ Revised Approach: Use the Refactored Notification System

Instead of calling functions from `.bin`, we should:

1. **Re-implement the summary logic using the refactored architecture:**
   - Use `MonitorDriveUseCase` to get file changes
   - Aggregate the data in `Application.js`
   - Use the refactored Notification system
   - Format as Block Kit within the SlackWebhookClient

2. **Or:** Create a new `SummaryUseCase` that follows Clean Architecture:
   - Gets data from repositories
   - Formats using Block Kit
   - Sends via SlackWebhookClient

---

## üìù Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. ‚úÖ **Revert `Application.js` to use the existing Notification system** (safest, uses refactored code)
2. üî® **Create new modules to properly port these functions** (proper refactor, more work)
3. üõ†Ô∏è **Keep using `.bin` functions but document them** (pragmatic, works now)

What's your preference?
