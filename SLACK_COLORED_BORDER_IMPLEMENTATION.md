# Slack Colored Border Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### **Colored Left Border for Daily/Weekly Summaries**

**File: `src/core/entities/Notification.js`**

Updated the `toSlackPayload()` method to add a **light blue (#a3d9ff) colored left border** for daily and weekly summary notifications:

```javascript
toSlackPayload() {
  // Use custom color for daily/weekly summaries
  let color = this._getPriorityColor();
  if (this._type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.DAILY_SUMMARY || this._type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.WEEKLY_SUMMARY) {
    color = 'a3d9ff'; // Light blue color as requested
  }
  
  return {
    channel: this._channel,
    username: 'GDrive Monitor',
    icon_emoji: ':file_folder:',
    text: this._title,
    attachments: [{
      color: color,  // This creates the left border
      fields: [{
        title: 'Message',
        value: this._message,
        short: false
      }],
      footer: 'GDrive to Slack Alert',
      ts: Math.floor(this._timestamp.getTime() / 1000)
    }]
  };
}
```

## üé® How Slack Colored Borders Work

### **Slack Attachments vs Block Kit:**
- **Legacy Attachments** (what we're using): Support `color` property that creates a colored left border
- **Block Kit** (from driveMonitor.gs): Doesn't support colored borders directly

### **The `color` Property:**
- In Slack's attachment format, the `color` property creates a colored left border
- The color is specified as a hex code without the `#` (e.g., `'a3d9ff'`)
- This creates the vertical "green line" you see in the Slack interface

### **When It Applies:**
- ‚úÖ **Daily Summary** notifications: Blue border (#a3d9ff)
- ‚úÖ **Weekly Summary** notifications: Blue border (#a3d9ff)
- Other notifications: Use priority-based colors

## üß™ Testing

### **Test Daily Summary:**
1. Call `sendDailySummary()` from the dashboard
2. Check Slack
3. **Expected:** Message with **light blue left border**

### **Test Weekly Summary:**
1. Call `sendWeeklySummary()` from the dashboard
2. Check Slack
3. **Expected:** Message with **light blue left border**

## üìù Notes

### **Why This Approach?**
- The `Application.js` methods use the `Notification` entity which converts to Slack attachments
- The `driveMonitor.gs` functions use Block Kit format (different system)
- Since the dashboard calls `Application.js` methods, we update the `Notification` class

### **Alternative (if using Block Kit):**
If you want to use the Block Kit templates from `driveMonitor.gs`, you'd need to:
1. Update `Application.js` to call `formatDailySummaryBlockKit()` from driveMonitor.gs
2. Send Block Kit blocks instead of using Notification entity
3. Block Kit doesn't support colored borders, but could use colored text or emoji

### **Current Implementation:**
- Uses Legacy Attachments format
- Colored border (left side) appears as requested
- Color is #a3d9ff (light blue)
- Applies to both daily and weekly summaries
