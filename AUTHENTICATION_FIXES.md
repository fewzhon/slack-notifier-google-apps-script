# Authentication & Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Issue 1: Login doesn't redirect correctly
**Problem**: After successful login, redirect went to "no access" screen instead of dashboard.

**Solution**: 
- Changed redirect from `?v=register` to `?v=dashboard` in both SSO and manual login handlers
- Updated both `handleSSOSuccess()` and `handleManualSuccess()` functions

**Files Updated**:
- `src/presentation/web/login.html` - Lines 279-284 and 318-323

---

### âœ… Issue 2: Sign out doesn't redirect
**Problem**: Sign out button clears session but stays on blank dashboard page instead of redirecting to login.

**Solution**:
- Changed redirect in `signOut()` function to use `?v=login` route
- Updated both success and failure handlers

**Files Updated**:
- `src/presentation/web/assets/js/dashboard-js.html` - Lines 88-89 and 100-101

### âœ… Issue 3: Dashboard loads after manual navigation
**Problem**: Dashboard accessible at `?v=dashboard` after successful login (working as expected).

**Status**: âœ… This is actually working correctly now due to fix #1
