## 📝 Notes

### Admin Email Detection
The code checks `config.adminEmails` array to determine if a user is an admin:

```javascript
const config = loadConfigurationFromProperties();
const isAdmin = config.adminEmails.includes(userEmail) || config.adminEmails.length === 0;
```

- If `adminEmails` is empty, everyone is treated as admin (for testing)
- If `adminEmails` has entries, only those emails are admins
- To test as non-admin, add your email to `adminEmails` list
- To test as admin, ensure your email is NOT in `adminEmails` list

### Summary Messages
The user mentioned needing to update the message template. Summary messages are built in:
- `src/Application.js` - `_buildDailySummaryMessage()` and `_buildWeeklySummaryMessage()`
